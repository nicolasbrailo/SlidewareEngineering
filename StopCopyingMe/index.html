      <li>Humans can't deal with echo. Hearing ourselves talk breaks our frail concentration, and we just can't speak anymore.</li>
      <li>The difference between self-feedback, reverb and echo are to a large extent psychoacoustic phenomena: <ul>
          <li>You hear yourself, all the time. This, hopefully, doesn't confuse you. It's what we use to modulate the volume of our voices. The time delay for self-feedback is less than 5 ms</li>
          <li>Beyond 5ms: we don't percive echo, we percieve our own voice as reverb. This is also normal for us: there is always reverb, and we don't notice</li>
          <li>Beyond 40/50ms: we stop perceiving a single acustic event. We start perceiving two distinct events (self-feedback+reverb, then echo). This is the one we can't deal with</li></ul>
      <li>We can't demo the difference between self-feedback, reverb and echo because this demo can't reach latencies that low, but you can still understand how echo impacts your speech.
          Try to read this text aloud while echo is active:</li>
      <li>Start the demo with "Start". Tweak the delay and the attenuation. You can build an intuitive sense of how annoying echo is, if you didn't already know,
          and you can also see how much attenuation you need before echo stops being a problem</li>
      <li>The rest of the demos here work in a similar way to this one, but are a bit more complicated</li>

    <summary>AEC demos</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The different demos present ways to solve the echo problem in a telephony system (how to avoid the speaker from being picked up by your mic).</li>
      <li>There are different audio samples with music or speech that you can use to test the AEC algorithm: playing something simulates echo from a far-end peer. The goal of this demo
          is that you should enable a loudspeaker, together with the mic, and see how well each algorithm can remove the speaker audio from the mic in the output</li>
      <li>The algorithm being tested will start receiving mic data once you click "Mic enable"</li>
      <li>Disabling the mic will enable the "Play" button. This will play back the output of the echo canceller while the mic was enabled. Clicking "Mic enable" will restart the recording.</li>
      <li>Debug tracks will start a recording of the AEC input, output and state. Once you stop the debug tracks, they will be downloaded as wav files that can be imported in audacity</li>
      <li>As part of the download, you will see a file containing raw near-end (mic) audio, raw far-end (speaker) audio, and AEC output (the processed near-end audio)</li>
      <li>Some AEC implementations may include other files, such as an echo estimate (the echo that the strategy THINKS should be present in the mic). This will let you understand the
          internal state of the algorithm</li>
      <li>Eval perf will print echo metrics to the browser's console (//TODO add a stats overlay)</li>
      <li>There are two plots: the left one shows the level of the audio in the speakers. The right one is the mic</li>
      <li>The text with a lot of numbers: stats of the algorithm. They make sense only when reading the code.</li>
      <li>You can use the "passthrough" mode to understand the natural attenuation from the acoustic path</li>

    <summary>Half duplex</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>A naive strategy for echo removal: we can disable the mic every time there is active far end audio.</li>
      <li>This is what early speakerphones did!</li>
      <li>Play with the sliders to see how hard it is to find a good setting: a release that's too short will result in few opportunities to "talk"
        (eg missing the first few words of a sentence when trying to reply). Too short, and the results will be bursty and noisy</li>
      <li>Play with different voices and content to see how hard it is to find a GLOBAL setting. What works for music, will break for speech. Even for different speakers,
          the attack/release parameters may have different set points</li>
      <li>The quality of communication is horrible. Half-duplex is very far from a natural conversation flow. Phonemes are 30 to 50 ms long, and humans frequently speak
          over one another to signal intent to speak or emotions such as agreeing or disagreeing. This is caused by humans' poor design, lacking an efficient off-band signalling system.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>This "AEC" implementation substracts the far-end signal from the raw mic signal.</li>
      <li>Unsurprisingly, it doesn't work. It probably sounds like a copy of the far-end signal. At best, you may get a comb-like effect.</li>
      <li>A naive signal substraction doesn't account that it takes time for the audio from your speakers to reach your microphone.
          This is due to the time it takes your system to output audio, the acoustic time-of-flight, and the time it takes your system
          to capture the audio again.</li>
      <li>A naive substraction will either result in two similar copies of the audio being sent, at best. If there is enough passive
          attenuation (your speaker is far enough from your microphone) then this algorithm will probably just sound like the original
          far-end audio.</li>

    <summary>Time-aligned substract</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>This implementation will calculate the loopback time (how long it takes sound from your speaker to reach the microphone). This is a dynamic number, and
          it's influenced by the acoustic path (the distance from your mic to your speaker), as well as your system (how long it takes for audio to travel from the OS
          to the real world)</li>
      <li>The time delay is calculated using cross correlation.
        <details><summary>You can change the xcorr config to see how it impacts processing time and accuracy.</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Min delay is the minimum assumed delay. Making this shorter shouldn't affect audio, but it will: the xcorr algo will have to learn the minimum delay, using a lot of compute.</li>
          <li>Update interval: how often xcorr should run. Smaller: quicker adaptation to acoustic environment changes</li>
          <li>Echo window: the maximum tail of the echo. Together with min delay, can be used to reduce compute (reducing too much means losing echo tails).</li>
          <li>Step size: how precise the xcorr should be. Xcorr implementation uses coarse and fine search, this controls only coarse search.
              If step size is too large, we can miss first peak of correlation. If it's too small, we can't compute this on real time.</li>
          <li>TX/RX threshold: rejects xcorr updates if there is no TX or RX signal</li>
          <li>Smoothing: smoothing factor for time delay. The algorithm can be prone to jumps without any.</li>
          <li>NCC Threshold: minimum threshold to consider the normalized xcorr matching. Below threshold, the algorithm assumes the signals are uncorrelated</li>
          <li>XCorr window: a longer window can make up for a shorter minimum delay, at the cost of compute. If the window is too short, we won't find a correlation between
            near end and far end signals.</li>
          <li>Echo attenuation: a gain for the echo path (this is unlikely to be 1: the microphone will have some gain over the speaker signal)</li>
        </ul></details></li>
        <li>Here, the reverb/comb effect is greatly reduced (not entirely, as the time alignment isn't perfect)</li>
        <li>But it does very little for the echo: the room coloration means the two signals are different enough that substracting them
          does nothing to remove echo. Plus, it's hard to get the attenuation right (we end up just changing the phase slightly)</li>
        <li>Time-alignment is necessary but not sufficient. We will need to model the path between speaker and microphone</li>

      Notes
      - Room impulse response:
        - Measuring RIR is disruptive
        - Note how the IR lenght needs to be longer than the echo tail, otherwise results are garbage
        - If the IR changes (people move around) then the IR needs to be recalculated
        - Playing with the echo attenuation let's us over/under attenuate, as the RIR isn't entirely precise. It's almost impossible
          to get a good value, there is a lot of residual echo.
        - Demo is SUPER hard to get right: the latency changes dynamically, and even a millisecond of difference breaks the AEC. It's likely
          that taking a few RIR measurements is needed before this demo work.
        - Parameters need to be tuned for each setup, especially echo attenuation.
