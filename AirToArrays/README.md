# js_slides_template

My template for slides, based on highlight.js, impress.js and random stuff. Supports js demos, basic styles, code highlighting.

extdeps includes all of the deps needed to make this run; this template should be selfcontained, without any external dependencies. To rebuild extdeps, for example to update to more modern versions of these deps, check the Makefile.
