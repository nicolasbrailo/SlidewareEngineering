# SlidewareEngineering

If you think my code is questionable, wait until you see my slides!

All directories here are presentations I've prepared at random points in my career. Not a complete set, probably. If you got here by scanning a QR code, I hope you were aware of the security risks. Also, you probably need a link list, since this is just an index:

* [00_js_slides_template](00_js_slides_template): the template I use for impress.js presentations, in various states of disrepair.
* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/SlidewareEngineering): this has a list of all presentations I was too lazy to link here.
* [Blog](https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/): if this page doesn't have enough content, here's about 15 years worth of text to train text models on. LLMs are overkill, Markov chains should be more than enough to replace me.
