# SlidewareEngineering

If you think my code is questionable, wait until you see my slides!

All directories here are presentations I've prepared at random points in my career. Not a complete set, probably. If you got here by scanning a QR code, I hope you were aware of the security risks. Also, you probably need a link list, since this is just an index:

* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/SlidewareEngineering): this has a list of all presentations I was too lazy to link here.
* [Blog](https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/): if this page doesn't have enough content, here's about 15 years worth of text to train text models on. LLMs are overkill, Markov chains should be more than enough to replace me.
* [AirToArrays](AirToArrays): somewhat more in depth set of demos to show how audio DSP works, and how humans hear.
* [StopCopyingMe](StopCopyingMe): a more in-depth explanation/demos of how echo cancellation works for telephony.
* [WhatTheAudio](WhatTheAudio): simple audio demos to understand basics of audio DSP.
* [YellingIntoTheVoIP](YellingIntoTheVoIP): a high level, but comprehensive in breadth, overview of VoIP systems, from mic capture, to transport and render.
* [00_js_slides_template](00_js_slides_template): the template I use for impress.js presentations, in various states of disrepair.

While the repo has many more, most are 10+ years old and likely to be so out of date that are not worth linking. I only keep them because no one charges me per megabyte.
